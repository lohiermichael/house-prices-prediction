Kaggle competition on predicting sales prices

## Preliminary steps

1. Clone the repository in your files

```git clone https://github.com/lohiermichael/house-prices-prediction.git```

2. Get in the repository

```cd house-prices-prediction```

3. Create a virtual environment. I personally use **Anaconda**

```conda create --name house-pred```

4. Activate the virtual environment
```conda activate house-pred```

5. Install pip in the virtual environment (no need if you don't use conda)
```conda install pip```

6. Install the requirements

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

7. Download the datasets from Kaggle. Make sure that you have a Kaggle account and that everything is setup. [Reference](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)
